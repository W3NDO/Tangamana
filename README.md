## Rails Hackathon Entry for team #31
You can find the hosted project [here:](https://tangamana.onrender.com)

### What is it?
It is a basic group chat app

for the hackathons MVP I figured I will create just one single room for my friends and I use. 

### Future plans
Later on I plan to add in functionality for other users to create their rooms. 

### Hotwire??
Hotwire is used to update the messages as they come in. More specifically turbo and turbo streams. 

### Issues
Scroll to latest message is still tricky rn. Working to fix that.
