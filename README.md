## Rails Hackathon Entry for team #31

### What is it?
It is a basic group chat app

for the hackathons MVP I figured I will create just one single room for my friends and I use. 

### Future plans
Later on I plan to add in functionality for other users to create their rooms. 

### Hotwire??
Hotwire is used to update the messages as they come in. More specifically turbo and turbo streams.
